# SOASTA CloudTest Plugin for Jenkins

The CloudTest Jenkins plugin provides the ability to:

* easily run the MakeAppTouchTestable utility on an iOS or Android project
* silently install an iOS app on a connected device
* play CloudTest compositions and include the output in the build's test results

### Configuration Options

You can add a new CloudTest server in the Jenkins configuration.  You will need the CloudTest URL, as well as a valid set of credentials.  _We recommend creating a dedicated CloudTest account for Jenkins to use._
